# Matrix Math Implementation
Contributor: Spenser Fong
## Overview (**PROJECT CURRENTLY ON HOLD DUE TO LIMITED TIME**)
A command-line program that allows users to find matrix echelon forms, RREFs, and more. It currently only supports finding echelon forms and RREFs.

REQUIRED FILES: matrix.h/cpp, main.cpp, Makefile

To run the program, do **make main** to compile, then do **./main** to run.

**TODO**
I currently plan on doing two things:
  1) Implementing determinants, inverse matrices, decomps (LU, QR, etc.)
  2) Executing matrix functions will not affect the matrix stored, and will therefore let users to call other matrix functions on the current matrix before scrapping the matrix.
